### Part2 reporting defects:
_____________________________________

unfortunately i couldn't catch any high or critical bug/defect, yet i spotted some ux issues that could be avoided as shown below:
1. The pro version features should be labeled or dimmed to avoid choosing them in case the user is not willing to pay for the pro version.
impact: having access to these features raise the user expectations, accordingly when he/she finds out 
that he/she needs to pay for the pro version it leads to customer dissapointment.

2. Entering data on dates other than the sysdate is misleading, couldn't be reached easily.
3. Some features needs a quick demo to know how it is calculated, such as the deposit behavior.
